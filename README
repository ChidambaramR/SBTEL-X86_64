1. Set the environment variables
   Following tools have been installed in ~vagrawal/cse502-tools/bin:
     - verilator
     - gtkwave

   To use these tools, you need to set the environment variables - LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH

   a) LD_LIBRARY_PATH as /usr/local/packages/mpc-1.0.1/lib:/usr/local/packages/mpfr-3.1.2/lib:/usr/local/packages/gmp-5.1.3/lib:/usr/local/packages/gcc-4.8.1/lib64:/usr/local/lib
   For csh,
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/packages/mpc-1.0.1/lib:/usr/local/packages/mpfr-3.1.2/lib:/usr/local/packages/gmp-5.1.3/lib:/usr/local/packages/gcc-4.8.1/lib64:/usr/local/lib

   For bash, 
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/packages/mpc-1.0.1/lib:/usr/local/packages/mpfr-3.1.2/lib:/usr/local/packages/gmp-5.1.3/lib:/usr/local/packages/gcc-4.8.1/lib64:/usr/local/lib

   b) PATH as /home/stufs1/vagrawal/cse502-tools/bin:$PATH
   For csh, 
     setenv PATH /home/stufs1/vagrawal/cse502-tools/bin:$PATH

   For bash,
     export PATH=/home/stufs1/vagrawal/cse502-tools/bin:$PATH

2. Building/Running the code
   a) Following are the commands to build and run the code
   make		// build code
   make run	// run code

   The result of running the code will be a 'trace.vcd' waveform file. You can view it using gtkwave (see instructions below).

   b) To change the program binary which you are decoding
   - Edit the following line in Makefile
     RUNELF=$(PWD)/prog2

3. Viewing the trace.vcd waveform
   You can login to the server using the -Y option. You can view waveforms using the following command:
     gtkwave trace.vcd
